It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Scope</strong></div><div>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of the personal information gathered by Link Stats when you use or access the Services, or when you view or interact with a Link Stats link (either our Link Stats links of one of our branded domains). This Privacy Policy also covers Link Stats’s treatment of any information about you that Link Stats’s customers share with Link Stats.</div><div><br></div><div>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that Link Stats does not own or control, including other companies’ websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you can access through the Services, such as Facebook or Twitter, or to individuals that Link Stats does not manage or employ. We cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Information We Collect</strong></div><div>Link Stats may collect personal information about you as described in this Privacy Policy when you (i) register for the Site and the Services, through your user account with Link Stats, including registering through a third-party social networking service (your “Account”), (ii) use the Services, or (iii) view or interact with a Link Stats link (either our Link Stats links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website. We collect the following types of information from you, some of which might be considered personal information under applicable law.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>When You Create a Link Stats Link</strong></div><div>One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of websites (“Link Stats Link” or “Link Stats Share Links”). Users can create Link Stats Links without registering for an account. &nbsp;When you create a Link Stats Link, Link Stats collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and, if you are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. Link Stats also collects and stores your IP address, your location, which we derive from your IP address, the time and date on which you shortened the original URL, and if you share a Link Stats Link on a social networking platform, the name of the platform and your username on that platform.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>When You Interact With a Link Stats Link</strong></div><div>Link Stats automatically collects personal information about the interaction (such as clicks or views) with every Link Stats Link created through the Services (either our Link Stats links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and location derived from the IP address; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language; (v) cookies, as described below, and mobile advertising identifiers and (v) information about sharing of the Link Stats Link on Third Party Services such as Twitter and Facebook (collectively, “Link Stats Link Metrics”). &nbsp;As described in this policy, we use Link Stats Link Metrics to provide the Services, to understand and analyze how our Services are used and to identify trends, and to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity. Please see the “Information We May Share” section of this Privacy Policy for a description of how we may share information we collect when you create, view or interact with Link Stats Links.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Other Information We Automatically Collect</strong></div><div>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect (i) your IP address and location derived from the IP address; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language; and (v) cookie information. This type of data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Site so that we can analyze and improve them.</div><div><br></div><div>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.</div><div><br></div><div>Link Stats may use third-party APIs and software development kits (“SDKs”) to provide certain functions in our Services.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Third Party Services</strong></div><div>Some features of the Services allow you to share your content and Link Stats Links through your accounts with other companies such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to connect Link Stats to such Third Party Services, we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts. We will ask you for permission before you authorize our collection of this information. We will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. We may also collect information about how you are using the Services to interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that account.</div><div><br></div><div>To enable us to infer the location from the IP addresses of computers or devices that visit our website or click, view or interact with Link Stats links as described in this policy, we receive IP-based location information from our third-party service provider. We also receive business contact information of our business customer contacts and prospects from our third party service provider.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</strong></div><div>Link Stats and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</div><div><br></div><div>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit our Site and use the Services through the web.</div><div><br></div><div>Link Stats cookies also allow Link Stats to track when you have clicked on a Link Stats Link. Each click of a Link Stats Link is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser and associated with Link Stats. We may associate the unique identifier in our cookies with the other information we automatically collect when you use the Services, as described above, including your IP address, Link Stats Links you click, Link Stats Links you create, and information with your Account if you have one.</div><div><br></div><div>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you will not be able to use some features of the Services.</div><div><br></div><div>We partner with third parties to track utilization and behavior on our websites, display advertising on our websites, and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click&nbsp;here&nbsp;or if located in the European Union click&nbsp;here.</div><div><br></div><div>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Link Stats only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Third Party Services. Link Stats does not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer, such as when you visit the website from a Link Stats Link. You can manage other companies’ cookies used for online advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s&nbsp;Consumer Choice Page.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Note Regarding Children</strong></div><div>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13 (or older as required by applicable law), we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Use Information</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We use the personal information we collect for a variety of administrative and business purposes to:</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">operate our Site and provide the Services,process and complete any transactions,verify individual identity,respond to inquiries, questions and comments and provide customer and technical support,provide access to certain functionalities of our Services,personalize and improve the Services and develop new products and services,to communicate with our current and prospective customers concerning our services,measure interest and engagement in our Site and Services,monitor and analyze usage and trends of the Site and Services,provide services to our customers to allow them to understand how you interact with our Services and to help detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity,comply with any legal obligations, andenforce our terms and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Usage Across Devices</strong></div><div>We may use the information we collect to make inferences that a unique individual has created or interacted with Link Stats links on different devices so that we can to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity and analyze how users use our Services. &nbsp;For example, if you created a Link Stats link on a computer connected to your residential WiFi network, and you soon thereafter clicked on a Link Stats link on a mobile device connected to the same WiFi network, we may infer that a single individual created and clicked on the Link Stats links because both events were associated with the same IP address in the same time period.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Other Legitimate Interests</strong></div><div>We also may use personal information to pursue legitimate interests, such as direct marketing, research (including marketing research), network and information security, prevention of fraudulent, malicious and unlawful activities, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information or allowed by law.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Information We Share</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The Services are designed to help you share information with others.

For example, when you create a Link Stats Link, the original URLs you have shortened and the corresponding Link Stats Links are publicly available.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Information We Share With Customers</strong></div><div>We may share the personal information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy with our customers. &nbsp;When you create a Link Stats Link of one of our enterprise customer’s sites, the enterprise customer is able to view the unshortened original URL, the date and time the Link Stats Link was created, the location where it was created as derived from your IP address, and aggregated information about clicks and views of the Link Stats Links, including the number of times the Link Stats Link was shared, whether or not it was viewed, comparison of that Link Stats Links performance to that of all Link Stats Links pointing to the same content, whether others are sharing a Link Stats Link to the same content, geographic regions where the content is being viewed, and identification of social networks on which the Link Stats Links appear. &nbsp;In addition, we may share Link Stats Link Metrics with customers to help them detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Information You Elect to Share</strong></div><div>When creating a Link Stats Link, you can share that Link Stats Link through Third Party Services. Any information that you elect to distribute through Third Party Services, such as a social network post you create, may then become accessible to users of those services. You can also access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links in the Statistics page for a Link Stats Link. We recommend that you review the terms of services and privacy policies of such Third Party Services that you access through the Services since Link Stats does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Services.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Information Shared with Service Providers</strong></div><div>We may employ and contract with third parties to perform certain tasks on our behalf and under our direction (our “Service Providers”).
